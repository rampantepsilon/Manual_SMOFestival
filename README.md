## Goal

Complete "A Traditional Festival" moon in Metro Kingdom after collecting 75 Power Moons & NDC Power

## Randomized

All moon checks starting from a new game. Moons only accessible through World Peace of each kingdom are available as checks. (220 total checks)

## Progression

Each kingdom has the original fights and story progression flags as a "Story" check. These checks are always on the appropriate checks (i.e. Multi-Moon Atop the Falls will give access to the rest of Cascade).

Moon totals for leaving normally still have to be met in AP prior to visiting the next world.

## World Unlocks
- 5 Moons = Sand Kingdom
- 21 Moons = Lake Kingdom & Wooded Kingdom
- 45 Moons = Cloud Kingdom & Lost Kingdom
- 55 Moons = Metro Kingdom
